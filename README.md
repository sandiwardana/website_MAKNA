MAKNA - Multi-page landing website

Steps:
1. Place files on PHP-enabled host (or local XAMPP/LAMP). 
2. Put your logo as `/assets/img/makna-logo.png` and hero/product images in `/assets/img/`.
3. Edit email in `includes/config.php`.
4. Upload and test contact form (mail() may not work on local dev; fallback writes to contacts.log).

Enjoy.
